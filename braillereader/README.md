# Braille Reader

A frontend interface for a translator from braille to "standard" letters, it is a rather simple program, all problem logic will therefore be handled in the frontend

### How to use

To input text, use the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 on your numerical keyboard, as this grid resembles the braille grid. Each heightened dot represents a number. Finish both letters and words with space. Translated text will appear under the translated word.

### Current limitations

The translator doesn't work for all languages (because of their individual special symbols). It does however work for all latin letters and Czech special characters, Czech being the first implemented language (due to being Czech myself).

### Updates in the future

The project will be updated further in the future, like improving design and controls for mobile, as well as turning it to a Progressive Web App (PWA) and make it downloadable as an app directly to your phone, even offline. Support for multiple languages and dark mode are also coming. If you had any remarks or suggestions regarding the current state or future development of this app, please let me know via contact listed in the footer.

##### Roadmap

### Inspiration

This website is a free-time project to help people to translate from Braille to standard text. The inspiration came from reading a magazine once, written only in braille. Not understanding it, I created a simple solution in Java. Having moved on to Javascript in the meantime, I decided to recreate it with a simple frontend UI and release it to the public, in case someone faced a similar issue as myself and was not satisfied with other Google results he has found.

### Donate

Since this project doesn't make any money from ads (because they only worsen the experience (and almost everyone is nowadays using AdBlock anyway)), I would be delighted if you tipped me some NANO in case you used it and liked it.
